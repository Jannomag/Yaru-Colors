### Icon Request

If you're filing an issue for a missing icon provide the following in your request:

- If it is an application, the file name of the icon used (can be found in the `Icon=` field in an app's `.desktop` file)
- If it is a file type icon, such as "JSON icon" please include its media type (can be found in a file's Properties dialog, e.g. `text/x-css`)
- If possible provide a screenshot, link-to, or copy of a related icon or logo.

Thanks!
