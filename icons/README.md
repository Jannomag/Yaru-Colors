Yaru Icons & Cursors
====================

This project is a revitalization of the Suru icon set that was designed for Ubuntu Touch. The principles and styles created for Suru now serve as the basis for a new FreeDesktop icon theme.

After which you should be able to pick Yaru as your icon or cursor theme in GNOME Tweak tool, or you can set either from a terminal with:

```bash
# set the icon theme
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme "Yaru"
# or the cursor theme
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface cursor-theme "Yaru"
```

To uninstall Yaru, simply run the following. (If you installed it without superuser priveleges just omit the  `sudo`.)

```bash
sudo ninja -C "build" uninstall
```

```bash
# reset icon theme to default
gsettings reset org.gnome.desktop.interface icon-theme
