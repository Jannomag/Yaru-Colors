**Yaru-Colors is a theme project to bring different colors to Ubuntu's awesome Yaru theme.**

[Original Yaru's git](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru)

*Update 2.0: Yaru developers updated the original theme, so I did. It cointains now the new light version from 19.10.*
*Maybe I'm able to create "Yaru-Classic" theme with the old darker header bars, but for now it was enough work to create 2.0*

*Screenshots included for every theme*

Yaru-Colors themes conataing following:
- GTK 2 / 3 theme
- Gnome-Shell theme
- Yaru icons
- Ubuntu-Dock theme (indicators)
- Wallpapers (see below)

**Following changes are made by me:**
- .css files for GTK3 and Gnome-Shell are edited. I changed all orange and purple tinted colors
- GTK2 images and Gnome-Shell graphics which were orange tinted are changed
- For the icon pack I just recolored the folder icons in 'places' and 'status'
- The dock got recolored app running indicators, which are changed by script, not by file

I tried to make the installation as easy as possible.
Therefore I created an installation script called install.sh. 

The installer will do a backup if something needs to be overwritten (only Ubuntu 18.10+).
It will guide you through everything and allows you to choose what you want to install.

**Installation with script:**
1. Run the installer with `./install.sh`
  -- for replacing `/usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/Yaru` for better compatiblity, run this script as root
2. Follow the installer
3. Done

**Removal with script:**
1. Rund the uninstaller with `./uninstall.sh`
  -- if you installed the shell theme to `/usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/Yaru`, run this script as root
2. Follow the script
3. Done

**Manual install:**
1. Copy your desired theme into your desired theme directory (example `/usr/share/themes` or `~/.local/share/themes`)
2. Copy you desired icon pack into your desired theme directory (example `/usr/share/icons` or `~/.icons`)
3. For better compatiblity you can optionally copy the files from a theme's gnome-shell directory to `/usr/share/gnome-shell/theme/Yaru` and overwrite everything AFTER you backed up the files
4. Enable your themes with gsettings commands or with gnome-tweak-tool
5. To change the dock indicator color (Ubuntu's Dash-To-Dock only), find the hex code for your desired color in the list below and enter following two commands (replace HEXCODE with your color code including #):   
`gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock custom-theme-running-dots-color 'HEXCODE' 2> /dev/null`   
`gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock custom-theme-running-dots-border-color 'HEXCODE' 2> /dev/null`   
(or do it with the script, it'll do it for you...)

**Wallpaper information**
All wallpapers are made by me from scratch. 
I made a wallpaper for each color and one with Ubuntu's stock colors.
I also added a bonus photo wallpaper, also made by me.
